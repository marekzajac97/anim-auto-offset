# Animation Auto Offset

This add-on provides a new animation editing mode, in which any changes to the object or bone transform (and other properties) will automatically propagate to all (or selected) keyframes at once, keeping the relative offset. You can use the standard move, rotate and scale operators or change the values directly in the object properties tab, without having to mess with the graph editor.
